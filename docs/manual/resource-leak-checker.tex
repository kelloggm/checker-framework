\chapterAndLabel{Resource Leak Checker for must-call obligations}{resource-leak-checker}

The Resource Leak Checker guarantees that every object in the program has
its must-call obligations fulfilled before it is de-allocated.

A resource leak occurs when a program does not explicitly dispose of some
finite resource, such as a socket, file descriptor, or database connection.
To dispose of the resource, the program should call some method on an
object.  (De-allocating or garbage-collecting the object is not sufficient;
the program must call the method before the object is de-allocated.)  For
example, the program must call \<close()> on every object that implements
the interface \<java.io.Closeable>.  The Resource Leak Checker can check
any property of this form.

However, this checker
is general enough to enforce any property of the form ``the programmer must call
all methods in the set of methods \emph{M} on object \emph{O} before \emph{O}
is de-allocated'' for any set of methods \emph{M} and object \emph{O}.
For resource leaks, by default \emph{M} is the set containing \<close()> and \emph{O}
is any object that implements the interface \<java.io.Closeable>.

The Resource Leak Checker works in three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Must Call Checker (\chapterpageref{must-call-checker})
over-approximates each expression's must-call methods as a
\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{MustCall} type.
\item The Called Methods Checker (\chapterpageref{called-methods-checker})
under-approximates each expression's definitely-called methods as a
\refqualclass{checker/calledmethods/qual}{CalledMethods} type.
\item When any program element goes out of scope (i.e., it is ready to be de-allocated), the Resource
Leak Checker compares the types \<@MustCall(\emph{MC})> and \<@CalledMethods(\emph{CM})> at the point of de-allocation.
It reports an error
if there exists some method in \emph{MC} that is not in \emph{CM}.
\end{enumerate}

By default, the Resource Leak Checker enforces that the \<close()> method is always
called on any object whose dynamic type might implement \<java.io.Closeable>.
You can extend this guarantee to other types and methods by writing
\<@MustCall> or \<@InheritableMustCall> annotations, as described in
Section~\ref{must-call-annotations}.


\sectionAndLabel{How to run the Resource Leak Checker}{resource-leak-run-checker}

\begin{Verbatim}
javac -processor ResourceLeak MyFile.java ...
\end{Verbatim}

The Resource Leak Checker supports the following optional command-line arguments,
in addition to those listed in Section~\ref{called-methods-run-checker} for
the Called Methods Checker:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \<-AnoLightweightOwnership> option disables ownership annotations,
 ignoring them in favor of the default ownership assumptions.
 See Section~\ref{resource-leak-ownership}.
\item The \<-AnoResourceAliasing> option disables resource alias support,
 treating \<@MustCallAlias> identically to \<@PolyMustCall>.
 See Section~\ref{resource-leak-resource-alias}.
\item The \<-AnoCreatesObligation> option disables obligation creation,
 issuing errors whenever a new obligation might be created instead.
 See Section~\ref{resource-leak-creates-obligation}.
\item The \<-AcountMustCall> option prints an estimate of the number of
must-call obligations in the analyzed program after typechecking is complete.
\end{itemize}


\sectionAndLabel{Resource Leak Checker annotations}{resource-leak-annotations}

The Resource Leak Checker relies on the type qualifiers of its constituent checkers:
the Must Call Checker (Section~\ref{must-call-annotations}) and
the Called Methods Checker (Section~\ref{called-methods-spec}). You might need
to write qualifiers from either type hierarchy. The most common annotations from
these checkers that you might need to write are:

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclasswithparams{checker/mustcall/qual}{MustCall}{String[] value}]
for example on an element with static type \<Object> that might contain a \<Socket>.

\item[\refqualclasswithparams{checker/mustcall/qual}{InheritableMustCall}{String[] value}]
on any classes defined in your program that have must-call obligations. See Section~\ref{must-call-on-class}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/calledmethods/qual}{EnsuresCalledMethods}] on a method in
your code that fulfills a must-call obligation of one of its parameters or of a field.
See Section~\ref{called-methods-ensurescalledmethods}.

\end{description}

In addition, the Resource Leak Checker supports annotations that express common
aliasing patterns related to resource leaks:

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{Owning}]
\item[\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{NotOwning}]
  expresses ownership.  When two aliases exist to the same Java object,
  \<@Owning> and \<@NotOwning>> indicate which of the two is responsible for
  fulfilling must-call obligations.  For details, see
  Section~\ref{resource-leak-ownership}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{MustCallAlias}]
  represents a ``resource-aliasing'' relationship.  Resource aliases are
  distinct Java objects that nevertheless control the same resource(s):
  fulfilling the must-call obligations of one element is equivalent to
  fulfills the obligations of the other.  For a more detailed description,
  see Section~\ref{resource-leak-resource-alias}.

\item[\refqualclasswithparams{checker/mustcall/qual}{CreatesObligation}{String value}]
  is a declaration annotation that indicates that the annotated method ``resets'' the must-call
  obligations of the target (i.e. the \<value> element of the annotation), which must
  be an in-scope Java expression. The default target is \<"this">. Multiple \<@CreatesObligation>
  annotations can be written on the same method, if their targets are distinct. For more details
  on obligation creation, see Section~\ref{resource-leak-creates-obligation}.

\end{description}


\sectionAndLabel{Aliased references and ownership transfer}{resource-leak-ownership}

Resource leak checking is complicated by aliasing: two or more Java
objects may refer to the same underlying resource, but each resource
actually only needs to be closed once.
For example, consider the following code that safely closes a \<Socket>:

\begin{verbatim}
  void example(String myHost, int myPort) {
    Socket s = new Socket(myHost, myPort);
    closeSocket(s);
  }
  void closeSocket(@Owning @MustCall("close") Socket t) {
    t.close();
  }
\end{verbatim}

There are two aliases for the physical socket that this code creates:
\<s> in \<example()> and \<t> in \<closeSocket()>.
If the Resource Leak Checker checked that \<close()> were
called on both aliases, it would issue a false positive on this
code, because it would warn when \<s>
goes out of scope in \<example()>.
Instead, \<closeSocket()> takes ownership of the socket---that is,
it takes responsibility for closing it. The \<@Owning> annotation
on \<t>'s declaration expresses this fact---it tells the Resource Leak
Checker that \<t> is the reference that ought to be checked, and that \<s>
can be safely ignored.

\<@Owning> and \<@NotOwning> always \emph{transfer} must-call obligations: must-call
obligations are conserved (i.e. neither created nor destroyed) by any ownership annotations
that you write, by construction. Writing \<@Owning> or \<@NotOwning> can never make the checker
unsound (i.e. a real warning can never be hidden by them),
but writing (or failing to write) these annotations can introduce false positives (i.e. extra warnings).

Constructor returns are always \<@Owning>.
The Resource Leak Checker's default for unannotated method returns is \<@Owning>,
and for unannotated parameters and fields is \<@NotOwning>. This treatment of parameter and
return types ensures sound handling of unannotated third-party libraries: any
object returned from such a library will be tracked by default, and the checker
never assumes that passing an object to an unannotated library will satisfy its obligations.

The features described in this section can be disabled by passing the \<-AnoLightweightOwnership>
command-line parameter to the Resource Leak Checker.
In this mode, the defaults described in the previous paragraph are always used, and explicit \<@Owning>
and \<@NotOwning> annotations are ignored.


\subsectionAndLabel{Owning fields}{resource-leak-owning-fields}

By default, fields are treated as non-owning.

Additional class-level checking is required for \<@Owning>
fields, as the code
satisfying their must-call obligations nearly always spans multiple
procedures.

For final, non-static owning fields,
which cannot be overwritten after initialization of the enclosing
object, the Resource Leak Checker enforces the ``resource acquisition is
initialization (RAII)'' programming idiom: a distinguished
``destructor''-like method \<d()> must ensure the field's must-call obligation is
satisfied, and the enclosing class must have a \<@MustCall("d")> obligation to
ensure the destructor is called.

Non-final, non-static owning fields usually require one or more \<@CreatesObligation> annotations
when they might be re-assigned. See Section~\ref{resource-leak-non-final-fields} for
more details on how to annotate a non-final, non-static owning field.

The Resource Leak Checker treats all static fields as non-owning, meaning that no assignment to one
can satisfy a must-call obligation.


\sectionAndLabel{Resource aliasing}{resource-leak-resource-alias}

\emph{Resource alias} sets are sets of Java objects that
definitely correspond to the same underlying system resource,
even if they have different Java types.
Calling a must-call method on one element of a resource-alias set
is equivalent to calling that method on all other members of the set.

Programmers most often encounter resource alaising when using \emph{wrapper types}.
For example, the Java \<BufferedOutputStream> wrapper adds buffering to some other delegate \<OutputStream>.
The wrapper's \<close()> method invokes \<close()> on the delegate---so calling \<close()> on either
will have the same effect (i.e., close the underlying resource).

Resource aliasing relationships are expressed in source code via pairs of \<@MustCallAlias> annotations:
one on a parameter of a method or constructor, and another on its return type.
For example, one constructor of \<BufferedOutputStream> is:
\begin{verbatim}
@MustCallAlias BufferedOutputStream(@MustCallAlias OutputStream arg0);
\end{verbatim}
The Resource Leak Checker uses these annotations at call-sites to treat the relevant variables as if
calling the must-call methods on one also called them on the other.
(Note that these \<@MustCallAlias> annotations already appear on
\<BufferedOutputStream> in the annotated JDK, so you don't need to write
them yourself.)

A pair of \<@MustCallAlias> annotations on a method or constructor \<m>'s return type
and its parameter \<p> can be verified if either of the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \<p> is passed to another method or constructor in a
  \<@MustCallAlias> position, and \<m> returns that method's result,
  or the call is a \<super()> constructor call annotated
  with \<@MustCallAlias>.
\item \<p> is stored in an \<@Owning> field of the enclosing class.
\end{enumerate}

Support for \<@MustCallAlias> can be disabled by passing the \<-AnoResourceAliases> command-line
argument to the checker. In this mode, resource-alias sets are not tracked by the checker,
and \<@MustCallAlias> is treated identically to \<@PolyMustCall>.


\sectionAndLabel{Creating obligations}{resource-leak-creates-obligation}

In a class that has must-call obligations,
every constructor implicitly creates obligations for the newly-created object.
However, non-constructor methods may also create obligations
when re-assigning non-final, owning fields or allocating
new system-level resources.
A post-condition annotation,
\<@CreatesObligation>,
indicates for which expression an obligation is created.
You can write \<@CreatesObligation(>\emph{T}\<)> on any method \emph{M} where the following
conditions are true (if the conditions are not met, the Resource Leak Checker will issue an error):
\begin{itemize}
\item if \emph{M} overrides a method \emph{N}, then \emph{N} is also annotated as
\<@CreatesObligation(>\emph{T}\<)> (\emph{N} may also have other \<@CreatesObligation> annotations).
\item \emph{T} is in-scope and parseable (see Section~\ref{java-expressions-as-arguments} for details on
what is parseable).
\end{itemize}
Writing \<@CreatesObligation> on a method that fulfills these criteria but does not actually
create an obligation may create false positives at calls to that method, but can never create
false negative (i.e. is sound).

When checking a call to a method annotated as
\<@CreatesObligation(>$expr$\<)>, the Resource Leak Checker
(1) treats the \<@MustCall>
obligation of $expr$ as \emph{satisfied},
and (2) creates a fresh obligation to check, as if $expr$ was a newly-allocated local variable.
Treating the obligation before the call as satisfied is sound: the checker creates a new obligation for calls to
\<@CreatesObligation> methods, and the Must Call Checker (\chapterpageref{must-call-checker}) ensures the
\<@MustCall> type for the target will have a \emph{superset} of any methods present
before the call.
Note that the expression to which $expr$ refers in the context of the method call must be owning
(that is, the Resource Leak Checker must be tracking its must-call obligations); otherwise, the checker
will issue a \<reset.not.owning> error at the call-site. You can avoid this error by extracting the relevant
expression into a new local variable (because locals are \<@Owning> by default).

If an \<@CreatesObligation>
method is invoked within a method that has an \<@CreatesObligation> annotation
with the same target---imposing the obligation on its caller---then
the newly-created obligation is treated as satisfied immediately (because it is instead imposed
on the callee of the method being checked).

Support for \<@CreatesObligation> can be disabled by passing the \<-AnoCreatesObligation> command-line
argument to the checker. In this mode, \<@CreatesObligation> annotations on methods are ignored at call-sites,
but re-assigning a non-final, owning field is always an error.


\subsectionAndLabel{Re-assigning to non-final, owning fields}{resource-leak-non-final-fields}

\<@CreatesObligation> allows the Resource Leak Checker to verify uses of non-final fields
that contain a resource, even if they are re-assigned. Consider
the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
  @MustCall("close") // default qualifier for uses of SocketContainer
  class SocketContainer {
    private @Owning Socket sock;
    public SocketContainer() { sock = ...; }
    void close() { sock.close() };
    @CreatesObligation("this")
    void reconnect() {
      if (!sock.isClosed()) {
        sock.close();
      }
      sock = ...;
    }
  }
\end{verbatim}

In the lifetime of a \<SocketContainer> object, \<sock>
might be re-assigned arbitrarily many times: once at each
call to \<reconnect()>. This code is safe, however: \<reconnect()>
ensures that \<sock> is closed before re-assigning it.

The Resource Leak Checker enforces two rules to ensure that
re-assignments to non-final, owning fields like \<sock> in the example
above are sound:
\begin{itemize}
\item any method that re-assigns a non-final, owning field of an object
  must be annotated with an \<@CreatesObligation> annotation
  that targets that object.
\item when a non-final, owning field $f$ is re-assigned at statement $s$,
  its inferred \<@MustCall> obligation must be contained in its \<@CalledMethods>
  type at the program point before $s$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The first rule ensures that \<close()> is called after the last call
to \<reconnect()>, and the second rule ensures that \<reconnect()>
safely closes \<sock> before re-assigning it. Because calling
an \<@CreatesObligation> method like \<reconnect()> also resets called-methods
inference, calls to \<close> before the last call to \<reconnect()>
are disregarded.
